# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

# Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to provide the employeer with lists of data outline which employees are eligible for a varity of different things.
# Results
* There is a large amount of workes that are set to retire soon
* There is some very strange variation in the salaries of the employees
* There are more employees retiring than are eligible for the mentorship program
* Most of the higher level postions are filled with more experiance workes and that will mean that as they retire there will lots of room for promotions

# Summary
There are more than 80000 roles that will need to be fileld as the silver tsumani hits
There may be enough to mentor them it really depends on time
You could write two querrys to help solve this. One would show how many workers that are heading to retirement can/will help to train. Say those that have two years left until they would retire
Last would be a count of how many mentorship eligible employees are in need of training per department.
